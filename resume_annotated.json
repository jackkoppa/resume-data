			"short": "Take a corporate website recently migrated to WordPress and improve style cohesion, functionality, usability, and international contact flow, while training in-house marketing specialist",
			"long": "
				Power Test Inc. had recently migrated their company site to WordPress, at the behest of SEO advisors. And indeed, Yoast SEO was installed, and there was improved logic to the home page headers. Past that, however, there was much to be desired in the site: different pages had inconsistent styling, navigation, and flow; the site lacked central design tenets; pages were difficult to find, and some important ones, nonexistent; very limited use was made of media; and the contact flow was extremely difficult and impersonal. The other issue Power Test faced was that, to address any of these issues, hiring the same outside firm had become prohibitively expensive.

				When I joined for a 3 week stint doing development and consulting, I spent the first 2-3 days discussing the company, their products, and a typical flow for a potential customer through the site. I met with the President, sales staff, and the sole marketing specialist for the small/medium company. It was quickly determined that customers, in the market for dynamometers (industrial equipment used to test very large engines), would likely need to follow one of three paths: knew nothing about testing aside from they wanted to test engines; already knew what product(s) they were interested in, and were trying to learn about Power Test itself as a reliable partner; or already knew about both those topics, and were just trying to reach out.

				With this in mind, I set out to improve flows through the site for all 3 types of customers. This meant vastly simpler navigation, consistent formatting across the site, short explanations on intro screens, more detailed explanations on product group pages, and consistent encouragement towards the contact page.

				Aside from large style improvements, embracing a “card” aesthetic, the most significant change was to the contact page. It is now personalized, by using a user’s IP address to show which salesperson is responsible for their region. They’ll be hearing from this salesperson after submitting the form, which itself has been greatly reduced in complexity, with the theory that some contact is much better for the phone-based company than no contact. Finally, the same IP recognition is used to hold together a rather complex international targeting/translation implementation, with cookies/sessions: upon a first visit to the site, a foreign user is asked in their native tongue if they would like to view their local version. If so, subdirectories are used to provide machine-translated versions of every single page. Very importantly, these machine-generated pages are both human-editable (for the company’s future growth), and distinct server-side pages, allowing for SEO targeting of each subdirectory to a language and, in some cases, a country. Thanks go to the maker of WeGlot, which makes the machine-translation aspect possible.

				The last aspect of the work was training the in-house marketing specialist to handle future updates. Peter had some web design experience previously, but was able to quickly pick up the basics of server-database-dashboard, the various essential files for a WordPress theme, and the flow of information that determines what displays on each important page. With this training, Peter has been able to continue making updates to the site, upper management is very excited to be free of an outside agency that wasn’t working for them, and most importantly, inquiries through the site have increased 200% at this point.
