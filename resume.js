          "long": [
            "Power Test Inc. had recently migrated their company site to WordPress, at the behest of SEO advisors. And indeed, Yoast SEO was installed, and there was improved logic to the home page headers. Past that, however, there was much to be desired in the site: different pages had inconsistent styling, navigation, and flow; the site lacked central design tenets; pages were difficult to find, and some important ones, nonexistent; very limited use was made of media; and the contact flow was extremely difficult and impersonal. The other issue Power Test faced was that, to address any of these issues, hiring the same outside firm had become prohibitively expensive.",
            "When I joined for a 3 week stint doing development and consulting, I spent the first 2-3 days discussing the company, their products, and a typical flow for a potential customer through the site. I met with the President, sales staff, and the sole marketing specialist for the small/medium company. It was quickly determined that customers, in the market for dynamometers (industrial equipment used to test very large engines), would likely need to follow one of three paths: knew nothing about testing aside from they wanted to test engines; already knew what product(s) they were interested in, and were trying to learn about Power Test itself as a reliable partner; or already knew about both those topics, and were just trying to reach out.",
            "With this in mind, I set out to improve flows through the site for all 3 types of customers. This meant vastly simpler navigation, consistent formatting across the site, short explanations on intro screens, more detailed explanations on product group pages, and consistent encouragement towards the contact page.",
            "Aside from large style improvements, embracing a “card” aesthetic, the most significant change was to the contact page. It is now personalized, by using a user’s IP address to show which salesperson is responsible for their region. They’ll be hearing from this salesperson after submitting the form, which itself has been greatly reduced in complexity, with the theory that some contact is much better for the phone-based company than no contact. Finally, the same IP recognition is used to hold together a rather complex international targeting/translation implementation, with cookies/sessions: upon a first visit to the site, a foreign user is asked in their native tongue if they would like to view their local version. If so, subdirectories are used to provide machine-translated versions of every single page. Very importantly, these machine-generated pages are both human-editable (for the company’s future growth), and distinct server-side pages, allowing for SEO targeting of each subdirectory to a language and, in some cases, a country. Thanks go to the maker of WeGlot, which makes the machine-translation aspect possible.",
            "The last aspect of the work was training the in-house marketing specialist to handle future updates. Peter had some web design experience previously, but was able to quickly pick up the basics of server-database-dashboard, the various essential files for a WordPress theme, and the flow of information that determines what displays on each important page. With this training, Peter has been able to continue making updates to the site, upper management is very excited to be free of an outside agency that wasn’t working for them, and most importantly, inquiries through the site have increased 200% at this point."

            "We were tasked with the creation of this web app in the Fall of 2015 semester, and to finish, we needed to jump right in. The app would be built with Parse as the backend database, leaving us to choose front-end frameworks, server-side code, styling, and version control. We went with Backbone.js as our MVC framework, for its heavy documentation, ease of implementation with Parse, and low barrier to entry for all four of us. We used a version of Node.js for our server-side JavaScript, SASS for styling, and Git/Jira for version & project management. Throughout, I tried to keep us on a flexible schedule – our client was great about providing design documents, which put us on a great path from the outset. The biggest struggle was changing compatibility standards for Parse, which we managed by staying in consistent contact with each other, updating the team on where we had success and issues, sticking to an agile (weekly sprints) methodology.",
            "In the end, I was responsible for both project management, and a large portion of the development heavy lifting. With Tiago, I was able to learn the intricacies of Backbone.js, and learned to love it while finishing a fully functional, SMS-integrated photo sharing web app. We are proud of the result, shown above, which matches Aadit’s great vision, and will hopefully be launched to the public in the near future. At the end of the semester, I dove deep into our code, to add additional comments where necessary, and provide a guidance document for Aadit, should he choose to add features in the future. A great experience in team leadership, and creating a product we could be proud of, in about 3 months.",

This fosters communication outside the classroom, as well as a great appreciation of nature. Immediately, we realized that the best and most convenient communication route for us would be entirely online, almost entirely on our own website.",

            "To that end, peaksandprofessors.org has a variety of unique features: an email newsletter sign-up form on most pages, since that is the most important way for us to reach new student members, a calendar of upcoming trips with multiple views, a filter-able list of Professors, and perhaps most importantly, a completely custom backend. This customized dashboard allows any leader in the club to make edits to trip pages with no coding knowledge, while still keeping design consistent across the site.",
            "These updates have proved quite successful: since that Summer of 2013, up to May 2016, we have had over 80 trips, have 2,000+ email subscribers, and over 1,500 followers on Facebook. Perhaps most impressively, in 2016 Peaks and Professors was named USC's Student Organization of the Year, out of 800+ clubs. The most consistent comment from people who have signed up for the club? “I love the website!”"
